# InpaintingLecture

Lecture on optimization-based audio reconstruction, in particular audio inpainting based upon sparsity.

The repository contains the slides and accompanying audio examples.

The audio examples can also be played from the GitHub page [https://ondrejmokry.github.io/InpaintingLecture/](here).
